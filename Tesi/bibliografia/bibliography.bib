abstract = {The threshold voltage value, which is the most important electrical parameter in modeling MOSFETs, can be extracted from either measured drain current or capacitance characteristics, using a single or more transistors. Practical circuits based on some of the most common methods are available to automatically and quickly measure the threshold voltage. This article reviews and assesses several of the extraction methods currently used to determine the value of threshold voltage from the measured drain current versus gate voltage transfer characteristics. The assessment focuses specially on single-crystal bulk MOSFETs. It includes 11 different methods that use the transfer characteristics measured under linear regime operation conditions. Additionally two methods for threshold voltage extraction under saturation conditions and one specifically suitable for non-crystalline thin film MOSFETs are also included. Practical implementation of the several methods presented is illustrated and their performances are compared under the same challenging conditions: the measured characteristics of an enhancement-mode n-channel single-crystal silicon bulk MOSFET with state-of-the-art short-channel length, and an experimental n-channel a-Si:H thin film MOSFET.}

  title = {Basic mechanisms of radiation effects in electronic materials and devices. Final report, September 1986-September 1987},
  author = {McLean, F B and Oldham, T R},
  abstractNote = {This report reviews the primary physical processes underlying the response of electronic materials and devices to radiation as well as the relationship of these processes to the modes of circuit degradation and failure. An overview presents brief discussions of the major radiation environments of practical interest, the interaction of radiation with solid targets, common terminology of radiation exposure, and the primary radiation effects in electronic materials, including ionization effects (radiation-induced photocurrents and space charge buildup) and atomic displacement damage effects. An emphasis is given to the problem of total-dose ionization response, primarily in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) systems. In particular, a description of the basic physical phenomena underlying the complex time history of the MOS radiation response is given, and some implications of the time-dependent response for issues of radiation testing, hardness assurance, and radiation-response prediction are pointed out. There is also discussion on the implications of scaling down the gate oxide thickness and on the increasingly important problem of radiation-induced leakage currents.},
